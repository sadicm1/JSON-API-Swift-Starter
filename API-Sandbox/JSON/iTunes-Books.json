She let her ex take her daughter to Mexico while she stays behind in a strange town, sitting her former mother-in-law’s high strung little dog. It’s an opportunity to meet new people, but this California girl doesn’t have much in common with the ranchers in small town Marietta.&#xa0; Blake Canon perks up with male interest when he sees a new face at his friend’s Christmas cocktail party. His son is away and a light affair would take his mind off his financial troubles. Then he realizes he knows Liz. She was once married to the brother of his ex-wife.&#xa0; Their children might be cousins, but Blake and Liz do the kissing—under the mistletoe. It’s the beginning of a new view of Christmas for Liz, but when their children arrive home unexpectedly, and family secrets are revealed, Liz isn’t sure she’ll stay in Marietta for Christmas after all."

Nerd. Sorceress. This is the omnibus of the first three books in the bestselling Twenty-Sided Sorceress urban fantasy series by Annie Bellet, collected together for the first time in one convenient volume.&#xa0; Fans of The Dresden Files and The Iron Druid Chronicles will enjoy this series. Book One- Justice Calling: Jade Crow lives a quiet life running her comic book and game store in Wylde, Idaho. After twenty-five years fleeing from a powerful sorcerer who wants to eat her heart and take her powers, quiet suits her just fine. Surrounded by friends who are even less human than she is, Jade figures she’s finally safe. As long as she doesn’t use her magic. When dark powers threaten her friends’ lives, a sexy shape-shifter enforcer shows up. He’s the shifter world’s judge, jury, and executioner rolled into one, and he thinks Jade is to blame. To clear her name, save her friends, and stop the villain, she’ll have to use her wits… and her sorceress powers. Except Jade knows that as soon as she does, a far deadlier nemesis awaits. Book Two- Murder of Crows: They say you can never go home again. If only that were true… Game store owner and nerd sorceress extraordinaire Jade Crow knows death stalks her in the form of her murderous ex-lover, Samir, a sorcerer who wants to eat her heart and take her power. With the help of her friends, and sexy tiger-shifter Alek, Jade trains for the inevitable confrontation. Until her estranged father shows up begging for help. Someone or something is murdering the crow shifters of Three Feathers ranch and her father believes sorcery is the only way to stop the killings. Faced with an unknown foe, a family that exiled her decades before, a deepening relationship with Alek, and Samir’s ever-present threat, Jade will need all the power she’s gained and then some to stop the&#xa0;Murder of Crows. Book Three- Pack of Lies: Let sleeping dogs lie. Wolves, on the other hand… Recovering from a broken heart and coming to terms with her family history, all sorceress Jade Crow wants is to resume running her comic book store and gaming with her friends. With a town full of strange wolf shifters, a hundred-and-fifty-year-old peace accord hanging in the balance, and the Justice who broke her heart back in her life, Jade’s plans go out the proverbial window. Wolves are killing wolves, innocent human lives are caught in the crossfire, and not everyone in town is who they appear to be. As the bodies stack up and the doubts build, Jade and her friends race to find the true killer. And then Jade’s evil ex-lover makes another move… ---------------------------------------------------------- Additional books continuing the series and not included in this set: Hunting Season Heartache Thicker Than Blood Magic to the Bone"}, "im:vendorName":{"label":"Draft2Digital, LLC"}, "im:price":{"label":"Get", "attributes":{"amount":"0.00000", "currency":"USD"}}, "im:contentType":{"attributes":{"term":"MZRssItemTypeIdentifier.Book", "label":"MZRssItemTypeIdentifier.Book"}}, "title":{"label":"The Twenty-Sided Sorceress Series, Books 1-3 - Annie Bellet"}, "im:publisher":{"label":"Doomed Muse Press"}, "link":{"attributes":{"rel":"alternate", "type":"text/html", "href":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/twenty-sided-sorceress-series/id1004795436?mt=11&uo=2"}}, "id":{"label":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/twenty-sided-sorceress-series/id1004795436?mt=11&uo=2", "attributes":{"im:id":"1004795436"}}, "im:artist":{"label":"Annie Bellet", "attributes":{"href":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/author/annie-bellet/id428425964?mt=11&uo=2"}}, "category":{"attributes":{"im:id":"10044", "term":"Fantasy", "scheme":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/books-fantasy/id10044?mt=11&uo=2", "label":"Fantasy"}}, "im:releaseDate":{"label":"2015-06-10T00:00:00-07:00", "attributes":{"label":"June 10, 2015"}}},

Crying Wolf Grace Shaw is on the run from her crazy ex-boyfriend who refuses to believe their relationship is over. He's a cop and is willing to use police resources to track her down. So Grace comes up with a plan and tricks his fellow brothers in blue into thinking he is crying wolf a couple of times when he's reported her missing. Little does she know she'll go running into the arms of a real wolf when she finally makes her escape for real.&#xa0; She just wants to be left alone, but then she meets Hunter Tate - the alpha of the Black River Pack. Grace tries to hold Hunter at arm's length, but there's just no reasoning with an alpha male werewolf who insists she's his mate.&#xa0; Shoot for the Moon Eliza Reve knows that her ability to dream of future events sets her apart from others. Her gift became a curse when she wasn't able to save her mother or the alpha's son and she found herself exiled - a lone wolf. When she joins the Black River Pack, Eliza vows never to reveal her talent to anyone. Not even the man who has walked in her dreams for years.&#xa0; Spencer Tate is her mate, but her visions have told her that he will renounce her. When he doesn't recognize her as his mate, she agrees to the no-strings-attached affair he offers because she thinks it's the most she can hope for. Although her heart breaks as she falls deeper in love with him, she wants to spend as many days with Spencer as possible before he kicks her out of his life.&#xa0; When Spencer finally comes to his senses, he has his work cut out for him to convince Eliza that he wants her forever. When another she-wolf insists she's his mate instead, things get even more complicated. But Spencer isn't the alpha's second and enforcer because he isn't willing to fight for what's his, and he refuses to settle for anything less than Eliza as his marked and claimed mate.&#xa0; Thrown to the Wolves Annora Channing's entire world changes the moment she discovers she's a bear shifter. With mated wolves for parents, she should have been a wolf also. When the man she grew up thinking was her father realizes she isn't his daughter, he devises a plan to use her existence to his advantage in a way that will get her out from under his roof.&#xa0; When her situation goes from bad to worse, Annora escapes but is badly injured in the process. Luckily, Elias Reve comes to her rescue while on his way to Wolf's Point and the daughter he lost years ago. With nowhere else to go and nobody to turn to, Annora joins him on his journey and ends up running smack-dab into the arms of her mate.&#xa0; Parker Tate knows Annora is his the moment he lays eyes on her. When he manages to mate and mark her within hours of when they meet, he considers himself lucky. Then the trouble nipping at Annora's heels finds her and Parker realizes the path to claiming his mate won't be as easy as he thought - especially not with the bears involved."}, "im:vendorName":{"label":"Draft2Digital, LLC"}, "im:price":{"label":"Get", "attributes":{"amount":"0.00000", "currency":"USD"}}, "im:contentType":{"attributes":{"term":"MZRssItemTypeIdentifier.Book", "label":"MZRssItemTypeIdentifier.Book"}}, "title":{"label":"Black River Pack Series Box Set - Rochelle Paige"}, "im:publisher":{"label":"Rochelle Paige"}, "link":{"attributes":{"rel":"alternate", "type":"text/html", "href":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/black-river-pack-series-box/id979976062?mt=11&uo=2"}}, "id":{"label":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/black-river-pack-series-box/id979976062?mt=11&uo=2", "attributes":{"im:id":"979976062"}}, "im:artist":{"label":"Rochelle Paige", "attributes":{"href":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/author/rochelle-paige/id878856202?mt=11&uo=2"}}, "category":{"attributes":{"im:id":"10058", "term":"Paranormal", "scheme":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/books-romance-paranormal/id10058?mt=11&uo=2", "label":"Paranormal"}}, "im:releaseDate":{"label":"2015-03-30T00:00:00-07:00", "attributes":{"label":"March 30, 2015"}}},

But from the moment she boards the wrong train in Pisa, her plans for solitude and self-indulgence begin to unravel around her. When a bicycle accident lands Ani in the skilled hands of the dashing Dr. Cosimo Lazzaro, she reluctantly accepts his invitation to recover in his family’s country villa perched on a hilltop surrounded by the Lazzaro olive groves. But it’s been a black year for olive growers all over Italy, and generations of tradition are being put to the test like never before. Ani is swept up in the drama of life in Tuscany, the convergence of old and new, and the passions that drive people to pursue the desires of their hearts. Just as she begins to get her feet under her again, an unexpected turn of events leaves her doubting the very existence of happily ever after…unless she can learn to trust the desires of her own heart.

But as people make mistakes, they find themselves once again reliving the past, asking the questions that have remained unanswered. Until now. Charlie Mason fought hard to rebuild her life and find love again. When the ever-so-perfect Julian Baker proposes marriage, she leaves the past behind her to plan a future with him.
